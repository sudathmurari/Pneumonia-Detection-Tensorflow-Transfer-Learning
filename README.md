# Pneumonia-Detection-Tensorflow-Transfer-Learning
Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning Performed transfer learning to predict pneumonia based on chest x-ray data. Retrained the 'inception v3' image classifier on the pneumonia dataset using Tensorflow+Keras, showed the training process with 2 examples of it making predictions on images from the testing dataset.
